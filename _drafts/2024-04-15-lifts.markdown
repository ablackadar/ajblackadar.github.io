<p>Despite taking many Californian elevators and a growing number of Scottish lifts to get where I need to go every week, I only recently started actually listening to and recording their varied creaks, groans, and reverberations.</p>

<h2>Field Recording</h2>

<p>This project was developed as part of my MSc in Sound Design and Audiovisual Practice at the University of Glasgow.</p>

<p>The recordings are taken on my way to do something else, and as such capture my day-to-day experience navigating as an ambulatory disabled person who struggles with stairs.</p>
