Hi, I’m AJ Blackadar.

I am a sound designer, compulsive software spelunker, and master’s student at the University of Glasgow. My current focus is on the intersection of indie games, accessibility, and audio tools and implementation.

Stay tuned for a reel showcasing my best work. In the meantime, check my Experiments page for updates on my latest projects.
