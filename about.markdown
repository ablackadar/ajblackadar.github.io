        <p>I am a Californian who, through a series of carefully-crafted accidents, is making a new home for himself in sunny Glasgow. Sound design is my makeshift solution to a lifelong inability to settle on either a favorite subject in school or a primary musical instrument.</p>
        
<p>Prior to this move I completed a four-year foray into the study of perception, language, learning, and memory during a BS in Cognitive Science at UC Santa Cruz, at which time I began to experiment with game design, 3D animation, and assistive technology software. After realising I needed a screen reader more than I thought I did, I decided to narrow my focus to the study of the musical senses by enrolling in an MSc in Sound Design and Audiovisual Practice at the University of Glasgow, finishing Fall of 2024.</p>
        <p>As a result of how my disability impacts how I can interact with game audio tools, accessibility drives my approach to audio tools and implementation. My goal as a technical sound designer is to bridge the gap between accessibility consultants, who bring lived experience of how design choices can affect disabled players interacting with audio systems, and sound designers, who use tools like game engines and middleware to design those audio systems.</p>
