    <section class="center" id="about">
        <p>I am a Californian who is making a new home for himself in sunny Glasgow after enrolling in the MSc in Sound Design and Audiovisual Practice at the University of Glasgow, finishing Fall of 2024.</p>
        
<p>Prior to this move I studied perception, language, learning, and memory during a BS in Cognitive Science at UC Santa Cruz, where I began to experiment with game design, 3D animation, and assistive technology software.</p>
        <p>As a result of how my disability impacts how I can interact with game audio tools, accessibility drives my approach to audio tools and implementation. My goal as a technical sound designer is to bridge the gap between accessibility consultants, who bring lived experience of how design choices can affect disabled players interacting with audio systems, and sound designers, who use tools like game engines and middleware to design those audio systems.</p>
